## 0. One-sentence conclusion

The instabilities of the two cases (aortic valve in a straight tube / mitral
valve in a straight tube) converge on the **same root cause**:

```text
large transvalvular pressure difference during closure/systole
+ leaflets with no load-bearing mechanism (compressive stiffness /
  coaptation contact / chordae)
      -> coaptation region crushed (J -> 0.004 ~ 0.04)
      -> local runaway -> global divergence
```

This is **not** a convection-scheme problem, **not** a time-step problem, **not**
a J-clip threshold problem, and **not** a mesh-sliver problem (in these two cases
the slivers and the collapse locations do not coincide).

## 1. Reachable state at the end of this round

| Case | Configuration | Reachable |
|---|---|---|
| **AV, Stokes** | fibre mny + `--av-beta-s 5e6` | **1.635 s completed** (327,000 steps) |
| **AV, convection ON** | NH + SOU + feedback off + vessel-wall elasticity | 0.425 s |
| **AV, convection ON** | **fibre mny + SOU + vessel-wall elasticity** | **0.41–0.45 s** |
| **MV** | `--mv-rigid-c1 1e7` + leaflet stiffness x30 | **0.785 s completed** (125,600 steps) |
| **MV** | same, x100 | 0.785 s completed |

### AV: how the convection sub-goal progressed

| Step | Instability time | Measure |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point (central difference + feedback) | 0.16 s | — |
| Switch to SOU | 0.10 s (no improvement) | the scheme is not the cause |
| Feedback off | 0.335 s | positive feedback at the orifice edge (dose–response demonstrated) |
| + elasticity in the vessel wall/sinus | 0.425 s | 88.6% of cells previously had zero elastic stiffness |
| + real fibre constitutive model | **0.41–0.45 s** | the three measures are compatible |

### MV: from "won't run" to a full cycle

| Step | Reachable | Measure |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point | 0.375 s | — |
| + stiffness in the zero-stiffness region | 0.500 s | 41% of cells had zero shear stiffness |
| + leaflet stiffness x30 | **0.785 s completed** | empirical calibration |

## 2. Real defects found and fixed (7)

| # | Defect | Effect | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pk1_aortic_valve` **not stress-free in the reference state**: `P(F=I) = 2·C01·C10 = 1.9336e5 ≠ 0` | false prestress; the legacy form goes NaN within 1000 steps | `--av-iso-form mny` |
| 2 | The AV isotropic term treats `C01=12100` as an **exponential coefficient** (the same family uses 56–63) | one-sided material explosion, no restoring force in compression | same as above |
| 3 | `pk1_aortic_valve` **has no volumetric term** (CODE_AUDIT B25) | leaflet volume unconstrained | `--av-beta-s` |
| 4 | The GPU `k_assemble_pk1` supported only NH/Guccione, and `real_av.cu` hard-coded material **0** | the fibre model was unusable on the GPU path | `material==2` + per-element `fiber_dir.bin` |
| 5 | **41% of MV/tube/disk cells had zero shear stiffness** (CODE_AUDIT B24 family, caught by the T-g criterion) | the load had nowhere to go | `--mv-rigid-c1` / `--av-rigid-c1` |
| 6 | The `rigid_c1` path **was missing J clipping** -> marker 17 degenerate cell (`V_ref` 2.24e-10) NaN immediately | crashed in <500 steps | independent `rigid_Jclip` (default 0.2) |
| 7 | The instability report `std::max(a, NaN)` **swallowed NaN** | `max\|u\|` at the crash point was reported as 0 | explicit propagation (4 demos) |

## 3. Hypotheses ruled out (all measured, not guessed)

| Hypothesis | Test | Conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| Convection scheme unstable | Ported and verified SOU (linear-exact + second-order convergence 4.36) | ❌ the scheme is second-order correct; changing it does not fix the instability |
| Pressure projection under-resolved | A more accurate MG improved `\|div\|` by 3–4 orders of magnitude | ❌ still crashes at the same step |
| Mesh slivers | `--solid-vmin` removed them (MV 298 / AV 130) | ❌ no change; and the MV slivers are in the papillary muscles, not at the collapse location |
| J-clip threshold | AV scanned 0.2/0.35/0.5/0.8/1.5; MV scanned 0.05/0.2 | ❌ non-monotone, not the solution |
| Added mass / strong coupling | `--beta` scanned 0/0.5/1/2/4 | ❌ the trend is the opposite: **stronger feedback delays the crash** |
| Leaflet degrees of freedom too large | `--tether-mask all` | ❌ displacements drop by an order of magnitude but instability comes **earlier** |
| Leaflets too soft (single variable) | leaflet `C1/af` x10 | ❌ ineffective — the **disk crashed first**; the load merely moved |

## 4. Method: **layered diagnosis** (the most valuable lesson of this round)

**Each time a layer is fixed, the collapse moves to the weakest point in the next
layer.** So "adding one parameter at a time shows no improvement" is normal; you
must look at the collapse distribution (`diag_J.py`) **at the same time** to know
whether a switch is actually working.

The MV example (number of cells with `J<0.8` after `--mv-rigid-c1 1e7`):

| marker | default @0.3125 | after rigid @0.3125 | @0.4375 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 tube | 19 | **0** <- fixed | 2 |
| 6 disk | 1590 | **121** <- largely fixed | 1915 |
| 7/8 leaflets | 968 | 3756 | **15234** <- everything moved here |
| total | 2577 | 3882 | **17201** (`Jmin` 0.043) |

Final localisation (AV, step 80000):

| marker | `Jmin` | `J<0.8` |
|---|---|---|
| 5 tube | 0.940 | **0** |
| **15/16/18 leaflets** | **0.016 / 0.017 / 0.099** | **569 / 424 / 251** |
| 17 vessel wall | 0.603 | 3 |

The `Jmin` location `(4.10, 4.38, 10.11)` is the **coaptation region** near the
tube axis at z≈10.1, the same place as the crash cell `cell 623` recorded in
`aortic-valve-tube.md` §3.

## 5. CLI switches added this round

| Switch | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--av-iso-form legacy\|mny` | AV isotropic term formulation (mny = reference-state normalisation) | legacy |
| `--av-beta-s X` | AV volumetric term `2βs·lnJ·F^-T` | 0 (off) |
| `--av-Jclip X` | AV J clipping ⚠ **harmful for the exponential isotropic term**; prefer `--av-beta-s` | 0 |
| `--av-rigid-c1 X` | neo-Hookean modulus for non-leaflet markers (5, 17) | 0 |
| `--mv-Jclip X` | MV J clipping (**dedicated to the volumetric/exponential term**, it does not scale F) | 0 |
| `--mv-reg-c1 X` | small shear regularisation for all MV cells | 0 |
| `--mv-rigid-c1 X` | modulus for MV markers with zero deviatoric term (5 tube / 6 disk) | 0 |
| `--solid-vmin X` | skip degenerate cells with `\|J[e]\| = 6V_ref` below the threshold during PK1 assembly | 0 (off) |
| `--gpu-solid` (real_mv) | run the MV solid on the GPU kernel (18.3x speed-up, bitwise identical to CPU) | off |

## 6. Recommended commands

### MV: complete one cardiac cycle (~18 min)

```bash
cd fdm-3d-v1-gpu
DSH_CS_POIS=20 DSH_CS_HELM=8 DSH_FLAT_ASM=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 \
./build-av/real_mv --variant gao_0 --N 64 --T 0.785 --dt 6.25e-6 \
  --beta 1.0 --beta-body 1e8 --pk1-mask all --tether-mask 5,6,11,12 \
  --mv-Jclip 0.2 --mv-rigid-c1 1e7 \
  --mv-C1-ant 5.2110e6 --mv-af-ant 9.43788e6 \
  --mv-C1-post 3.06e6 --mv-af-post 1.5e7 \
  --nvc 2 --helm-nvc 1 --gpu-solid --every 10000 --out out_real_mv_cycle/
```

> ⚠ The leaflet stiffness is **30x the literature value** (empirical
> calibration); `|div|` rises to 0.1–0.3 during systole, so quantitative
> conclusions for that interval (regurgitation/closure dynamics) are **not
> usable yet**.

### AV: full run with the fibre constitutive model (Stokes, ~76 min)

```bash
./build-av/real_av --N 64 --pk1-mask 15,16,18 --tether-mask 5,17 \
  --beta-body 5e8 --z-clear 0.2 --radius 1.24 --feedback --feedback-kappa 1e5 \
  --open-bc --av-iso-form mny --av-beta-s 5e6 \
  --windkessel --wk-old --wk-freeze 0 --nvc 2 --helm-nvc 1 \
  --machine-error --dt 5e-6 --T 1.635 --every 1000 --out out_fiber_full/
```

### AV with convection (reachable ~0.45 s)

```bash
./build-av/real_av ... --av-rigid-c1 1e7 --pk1-mask 5,15,16,17,18 \
  --conv --conv-upwind    # Note: do not add --feedback (it conflicts with convection)
```

## 7. Remaining work (priority order)

1. **Solve compressive collapse in the leaflet coaptation region** — the last
   obstacle shared by AV and MV.
   Known ineffective: J-clip tuning, `--solid-vmin`, simply increasing stiffness.
   Directions: (1) an **anti-compression constitutive term** (a lower-bound
   penalty on J / anisotropic compressive stiffness); (2) **coaptation contact**
   (one-sided constraints between the anterior and posterior leaflets; a real
   valve supports itself through the coaptation surface); (3) **chordae
   constraints** (`mv_gao_*` has no `tether_kind.bin`/`tether_dir.bin` at all,
   and `assemble_tether` is a silent no-op); (4) re-mesh the coaptation region.
2. The **"15x speed-up" rule in `aortic-valve-tube.md` §4 needs correcting**:
   `DSH_CS_POIS=20 / DSH_CS_HELM=8` was calibrated on the AV mesh; after changing
   the domain it must be re-calibrated, and the acceptance criterion is whether
   **`|div|` grows in time** (stable on AV, but it grows by 3–4 orders of
   magnitude on MV).
3. Run MV with **real leaflet parameters** (the current result relies on a 30x
   empirical calibration).
4. GPU still does not support `SarahMV` / `LVMV` / `RealLV` materials; `mv_ibamr`
   data is missing on this machine.

## 8. Tests and regression

`fdm-3d-v1-gpu/test/` (all PASS):

- `test_ibm_pk1_aortic_valve_gpu`: AorticValve GPU/CPU consistency + `F=I`
  invariance
- `test_ibm_pk1_mitral_valve_gpu`: MitralValve consistency + `F=I` + **shear
  stiffness scan (T-g)**
- `test_unit_convection_cuda`: SOU **linear exactness (both upwind branches) +
  second-order convergence**
